2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.287 ns between low_freq_led/clk_div/count_out_sig_reg[8]/C (clocked by mmcm_clk) and low_freq_led/clk_div/count_out_sig_reg[10]/S (clocked by mmcm_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.287 ns between low_freq_led/clk_div/count_out_sig_reg[8]/C (clocked by mmcm_clk) and low_freq_led/clk_div/count_out_sig_reg[13]/S (clocked by mmcm_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
